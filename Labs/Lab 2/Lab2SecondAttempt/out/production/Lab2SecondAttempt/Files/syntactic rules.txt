The words - predefined tokens are specified between double quotes (ex: "predefined", "for")

Syntactic rules:

(**) initialization, declaration..

program = "MAIN" cmpdstmt

IDdecl = "DECLARE" IDENTIFIER type
ARRdecl = "DECLARE" array "array" "[" type "]"

type = "integer" | "char" | "float"

declaration = IDdecl | ARRdecl


(**) repetitive & conditional statements

forstmt = "FOR" IDENTIFIER "IN" forcondition cmpdstmt

forcondition = "(" expression ":" expression ")"

whilestmt = "WHILE" condition cmpdstmt

ifstmt = "IF" condition cmpdstmt ["ELSE" cmpdstmt]

condition = "(" expression relation expression ")"

(**) expression-related

expression = expression "+" term | expression "-" term | term

term = term "*" factor | term "/" factor | factor

factor = "(" expression ")" | IDENTIFIER | integer | float

relation = "<" | "<=" | "==" | ">=" | ">" | "!="


(**) general statements

assignstmt = IDENTIFIER "=" (expression | charconst | stringconst ) 
(**)	   | ARRAY "=" (expression | charconst | stringconst ) 

iostmt  = "READ" "(" identifier ")" | "WRITE" "(" identifier ")" 
	| "READ" "(" array")" | "WRITE" "(" array ")"
(**)    | "WRITE" "(" const ")"

cmpdstmt = "{" stmtlist "}"

stmtlist = stmt | stmt ";" stmtlist

stmt = simplestmt | structstmt 

simplstmt = declaration | assignstmt | iostmt

structstmt = cmpdstmt | ifstmt | forstmt | whilestmt
